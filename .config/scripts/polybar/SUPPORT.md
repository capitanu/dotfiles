Getting Help
============

If you need help or troubleshooting tips or just have a question:

* Read the [Known Issues page](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Known-Issues), maybe others had the same issue before.
* Read the [Wiki page](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki) for the thing you have problems with.
* Ask in our reddit community at [r/polybar](https://www.reddit.com/r/polybar)
* Join the official IRC channel `#polybar` on the `chat.freenode.net` network. Make sure to let your IRC client be connected long enough to get an answer, if you disconnect after 15 minutes, you will likely not get any response.
* Ask on [Unix & Linux StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/). Though not all questions may be suited over there, make sure you're [on topic](https://unix.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).

Please **do not** use the github issue tracker to ask for help or if you have a question, it is meant for bug reports and feature requests. Issues will be closed and you will be referred to the above resources.
